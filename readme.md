# Loops and lottery machine

No link. PHP exercises, the server-related instructions won't work.

## What I learned


### Loop exercise
* Arrays: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays.asp
* Foreach: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_looping_for.asp

### Lottery exercise

* Shuffle: https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_shuffle.asp

## Difficulties

### Loop exercise

In the key of my array() variable, I initially wrote "tv-show" but in the table the name of the show didn't appear. It was a stupid mistake that made me waste a lot of time! After I removed the "-", everything went well.

### Lottery exercise

For some unknown reason, the "win or lose" message displayed after the order is sent works 90 percent of the time. Once in a while, the message is not in line with the result. Same in Firefox and Chrome. Maybe it's because the index page is not always refreshed but I'm not sure.

## Feedback

* The first loop exercise was well explained and doable.
* The instructions of the lottery exercise were not clear: you don't know whether the player has to chose one emoji and then check if it's the winning one, or if they have to sort the three eomojis in a certain order and then check if the combinaition is winning. It would have been nice to have an example in order to "visualize" the ouput.
